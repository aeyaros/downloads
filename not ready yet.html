  <h2>Mac OS Tile Wallpaper Recreations</h2>
  <hr>

  <div class="moduleBanner" style="background-image: url('')"></div>

  <p>
    These are wallpaper tiles I created. They are based on the embossed Finder tiled wallpaper images from Mac OS 7.5 and Mac OS 8.5, except they use the newer Finder icon from macOS 11 and the newer SF font. Also included is a recreation of the desktop tile used on Mac OS 8/9 CD installers (when booted as a startup disk).

    Included are 128px and 256px tiled wallpapers images. Keep in mind, classic Mac OS tiles each image from the top left corner, while modern macOS centers the pattern.
