  <h2>Mac OS Tile Wallpaper Recreations</h2>
  <hr>

  <div class="moduleBanner" style="background-image: url('')"></div>

  <p>
    These are wallpaper tiles I created. They are based on the embossed Finder tiled wallpaper images from Mac OS 7.5 and Mac OS 8.5, except they use the newer Finder icon from macOS 11 and the newer SF font. Also included is a recreation of the desktop tile used on Mac OS 8/9 CD installers (when booted as a startup disk).
  </p>

  <p>
    Included are 128px and 256px tiled wallpapers images. Keep in mind, classic Mac OS tiles each image from the top left corner, while modern macOS centers the pattern.

  <h2>Lisa System font (and WDEF) for Mac OS 6</h2>
  <hr>

  <div class="moduleBanner" style="background-image: url('')"></div>

  <p>
    This is a font I created mimicing the appearance of the Lisa's system font (nicknamed "Twiggy." It should be usable in classic versions of Mac OS, such as System 7, System 6, and earlier versions. The font is based on the original Chicago font and includes the same character set. To install, use Font/DA mover to move the font from the included font-suitcase into the system file.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also included here is a disk image containing a WDEF. I believe I hacked this together from the "Eric's WDEF" extension (I think? It's been a little while since I put this together) and the Lisa WDEF from ClickChange 1.x; it requires my Lisa system font, which should be installed first. Then, just drag the WDEF into your system folder.

  <h2>Big Sur Icon Packs</h2>
  <hr>

  <div class="moduleBanner" style="background-image: url('')"></div>

  <p>
    These are macOS Big Sur style icons I've created. Included here are icon packs for various emulator apps including Mini vMac, LisaEm, Dolphin, and more! Just download the zip file for each pack.
  </p>
  <p>

    To add the icon to an application, select the application in the finder. Go to the file menu and click "Get Info" to open a window containing information about the applicaton file. Next, find the PNG of the icon you wish to add and drag it to the app icon in the info window.
  </p>

  <p>
    For help installing the icons, see this page on macosicons.com. To use the disk image icons with Mini vMac, use the instructions on this page on the Mini vMac website.
