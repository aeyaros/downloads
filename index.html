			<h2>Lisa System font (and WDEF) for Classic Mac OS</h2>
			<hr>

			<div class="moduleBanner" style="background-image: url('files/banners/twiggy.png')"></div>

			<p>
				This is a version of the Lisa System font I recreated for use in old versions of the Macintosh System Software (Systems 1-5, 6, and 7). This font is often nicknamed "Twiggy" after the original Lisa 1's proprietary disk drives. The font is based on the original Chicago font and includes the same character set (I used Chicago as a starting point when I created this font using FONTastic). Frankly, the main reason I made this was because I couldn't find the font anywhere else in this format!
			</p>

			<p>
				It is available to download on an 800KB disk copy image file. This file can be opened in emulators like Mini vMac, or copied to a real Macintosh and opened using Disk Copy (or burned to a floppy disk). Once you have the disk mounted, you can install the font using the Font/DA mover tool. See the read-me file inside the disk image for more information.
			</p>

			<p>
				Also included on the disk image is an extension for System 6 that will make your windows look like those on the Lisa Office System. If I remember correctly, I hacked this together from the "Eric's WDEF" extension (I think? It's been a little while since I put this together) and the Lisa WDEF from ClickChange 1.x. It requires my Lisa system font, which should be installed first. Then, just drag the extension into your system folder.

			<h2>1984 Redux Summerboard Theme for iPhone OS 1</h2>
			<hr>

			<div class="moduleBanner" style="background-image: url('files/banners/1984.png')"></div>

			<p>
				This is an extensive rework of the original "1984" summerboard theme for iPhone OS 1 by Chris Reiff (Mr_Sparkle). It is an incredible 1-bit theme designed to make your iPhone 2G or iPod Touch 1G look like a Macintosh from 1984! In the original theme, many of the icons were drawn inconsistently and had scaling artifacts. All the icons have been fixed or redrawn entirely to be pixel-perfect at 2X scale (appropriate, as they approximate the 32px dimension of large icons on the original Macintosh). I have also included new icons for many apps. There are nearly a hundred unique icons in this theme!
			</p>
			<p>
				This will work fine on a jailbroken iPhone 2G or iPod Touch 1G with Summerboard installed. It will probably work fine on newer versions of iOS in Winterboard. I reccomend using an era-appropriate version of DiskAid to transfer over the files.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the future I'd like to host an Installer 3 repo once I can figure out how that all works. Also, if anyone has any icon suggestions, let me know via the email link at the bottom of my homepage and if I have time I'll include them in a newer version of the theme. If anyone who is still hosting an Installer 3 repo wants to add this theme, please email me! ........Lastly, if anyone has a copy of the beta version of Raging Thunder (the one that runs in portrait mode) please let me know...

			<h2>Picasso Lisa/Mac Mousepads</h2>
			<hr>

			<div class="moduleBanner" style="background-image: url('files/banners/mousepads.png')"></div>

			<p>
				These are mousepad images you can print out to use with your vintage computer. I found the Picasso Mac image on a cute little vintage mousepads website which is now offline. I then created a "Picasso Lisa" version to compliment it. This involved rearranging the elements in the Picasso Lisa artwork from the Lisa 2 user manual so they matched the layout and orientation of the Picasso Mac artwork.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also used Motter Tektura next to the Apple logo instead of Garamond, as this better reflects Apple's branding when the Lisa was originally released in 1983. I realize the Picasso Lisa <i>doesn't</i>... but it's my mousepad design and I don't <i>really</i> have to perfectly justify these things!
			</p>

			<p>
				The images can be downloaded and printed at a printer of your choice. I used VistaPrint and picked their thick mousepads. They turned out well!
			</p>

			<h2>Lisa Keyboard Reference Card Cutouts</h2>
			<hr>

			<div class="moduleBanner" style="background-image: url('files/banners/cutouts.png')"></div>

			<p>
				These are correctly scaled replicas of the reference cards included with the Apple Lisa keyboard. These cards are inserted into the bottom of the Lisa and can be pulled by their tabs out from under the keyboard.
			</p>

			<p>
				To use these, you will need to print them yourself and carefuly cut them out. Included are both colored and monochrome versions (in case you don't have a color printer). Obviously, these will not be of much use unless you actually have a Lisa (and a Lisa Keyboard).
